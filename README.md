This is the seventh project I did for the Campus 19 Common Core (part of the international 42 Network): the classic dining philosopher problem, introducing threads and mutexes.

From the documentation:

_In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes._ 

Allowed eternal functions: memset, printf, malloc, free, write, usleep, gettimeofday, pthread_create, pthread_detach, pthread_join, pthread_mutex_init, pthread_mutex_destroy, pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_unlock.

Score: 100/100
